/**
 * Run an "EZ" version of the grid engine. You initialize the loop with the
 * width, height, a pointer to the pixel array, and a pointer to the user data.
 * (The user data may be a pointer to anything the user wants, they just need to
 * cast it to a void pointer.) The EZ loop takes care of the rest!
 *
 * The loop function will be called periodically by the loop. It's responsible
 * for updating the pixel array in whatever way the user sees fit. The loop
 * function receives the pointer to the grid, the pointer to the user data, and
 * the current time step in milliseconds. The grid and user data are the same
 * values that were passed to `ge_ez_loop`. The time step can be used in pixel
 * calculations, to find a constant rate of change.
 *
 * The event handler function is optional and will be called for each event that
 * occurs. It's responsible for handling and reacting to events in whatever way
 * the user sees fit. Events are things like keypresses, etc, see "event.h" for
 * details. The event handler function receives the pointer to the grid, the
 * pointer to the user data, and the current time step in milliseconds (just
 * like the loop function), as well as the pointer to the event.
